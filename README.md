# Minesweeper

This is a simple minesweeper game written in Python. I used the pygame library for the GUI. 


## Features

* Customizable grid sizes
* Custom diffuculty settings
* Timer
* Hand drawn graphics


In the future, I plan to add a high score system and a way to save your progress. I also plan to remake the code to generate clusters of mines because they are too spread out at the moment.
